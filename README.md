## Instruction
To use of just lexical analyzer is pretty simple and it just need to invoke it, then it run over `sample.c` (it set by default.) 
> PS : You can change the input C file in lexical_analyzer.py for tokenizing custom file.

And the a `tokens.dat` file will be created as output which contain the crosspoinding tokens.

After run the lexical analyzer you can check whether the any ``for loop`` are written correctly or not by running ``CParser.py`` . But it would need to run the lexical analyzer first.
